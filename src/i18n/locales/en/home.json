    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How does payment actually work?",
        "answer": "We get paid based on customers delivered. For B2C with monthly recurring revenue, payment is per active subscription. For B2B contract-based sales, payment is per closed deal. No monthly retainers, no upfront costs—only results."
      },
      {
        "question": "What industries do you work with?",
        "answer": "We specialize in B2B companies with complex sales cycles, particularly those expanding into Quebec or scaling multi-channel acquisition. Telecommunications, SaaS, financial services, and professional services are our sweet spots."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can we get started?",
        "answer": "Our streamlined onboarding gets you up and running in 30 days—compared to the 11+ months it takes to build an in-house team. Your dedicated account manager handles everything from strategy to team deployment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes you different from traditional agencies?",
        "answer": "Three things: (1) Deep Quebec market expertise you can't build overnight, (2) Multi-channel mastery—not just one tactic, and (3) A proven $40M track record with TELUS. We don't just generate leads; we build sustainable growth engines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you require long-term contracts?",
        "answer": "No. We work on performance terms with flexible engagement models. Because we only get paid when you get customers, our incentives are aligned. Most clients stay because the results speak for themselves."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you measure success?",
        "answer": "Customers acquired, customer acquisition cost (CAC), and revenue generated. We integrate with your CRM and tracking systems to provide full transparency. Every customer is tracked, attributed, and tied to our delivery."
